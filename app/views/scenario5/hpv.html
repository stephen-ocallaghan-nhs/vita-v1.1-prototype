  <div class="nhsuk-details__text">
    <p>The HPV vaccine reduces your chances of getting human papillomavirus (HPV), a common virus that's spread through skin contact (usually when having sex).</p>
    <p>Most types of HPV are harmless. But some types are linked to an increased risk of certain types of cancer, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>cervical cancer</li>
      <li>mouth cancer</li>
      <li>anal cancer</li>
      <li>penile cancer</li>
      <li>vulval cancer</li>
      <li>vaginal cancer</li>

    </ul>
    <p>HPV can also cause genital warts.</p>

        Who should have the HPV vaccine

    <div class="nhsuk-details__text">
      <p>The HPV vaccine is recommended for children aged 12 to 13 years old and people at higher risk from HPV.</p>
      <h3>Children aged 12 to 13</h3>
          <p>All children aged 12 to 13 (school year 8) are offered the HPV vaccine.</p>
          <p>If you missed getting vaccinated when you were 12 or 13, the HPV vaccine is available for free on the NHS for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>all girls under 25</li>
            <li>boys born after 1 September 2006</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Contact your school nurse, school vaccination team or GP surgery if you or your child were eligible for the HPV vaccine but did not get vaccinated.</p>

      <h3>Men aged 45 and under who have sex with men</h3>         
          <p>Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men are at higher risk from HPV.</p>
          <p>If you're a man aged 45 or under who has sex with men and you attend a sexual health or HIV clinic, you can get vaccinated against HPV.</p>
          <p>You're eligible for the vaccine up until your 46th birthday.</p>

      <h3>Other people at risk of HPV</h3>
          <p>The HPV vaccine is also sometimes recommended for other people at higher risk from HPV, such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>any transgender people who are felt to have the same risk as men who have sex with men</li>
            <li>sex workers</li>
            <li>people with HIV</li>
          </ul>

      <h2>Who cannot have the HPV vaccine</h2>
      <p>Most people who are eligible for the HPV vaccine can have it.</p>
      <p>You only cannot have the vaccine if you've had a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to a previous dose of the vaccine, or an ingredient in the vaccine.</p>
      <p>There's no evidence the vaccine is harmful if you're pregnant, but sometimes you may be advised to wait until you're no longer pregnant before having the vaccine.</p>
      <p>You can have the HPV vaccine while breastfeeding.</p>
