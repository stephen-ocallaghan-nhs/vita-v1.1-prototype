    <div class="nhsuk-details__text">
      <p>The RSV vaccine helps protect against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
        RSV is a common cause of coughs and colds. Most people get it several times during their life.</p>
      <p>It usually gets better by itself, but in some people (especially babies and older adults) it can cause illnesses such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>pneumonia (a lung infection)</li>
        <li>bronchiolitis (a chest infection that affects babies)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These illnesses can cause serious breathing problems. They may need to be treated in hospital and can be life-threatening. 
           <div class="nhsuk-u-padding-bottom-3"></div>
      Getting RSV can also make your symptoms worse if you have a lung condition, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD).
           <div class="nhsuk-u-padding-bottom-3"></div>
      The RSV vaccine helps reduce the risk of serious breathing problems like pneumonia and bronchiolitis.</p>

      <p>Try to check your blood:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>before meals</li>
        <li>2 to 3 hours after meals</li>
        <li>before, during (take a break) and after exercise</li>

      <p>This helps you understand your blood glucose levels and how they’re affected by meals and exercise. It should help you have more stable blood glucose levels.</p>
