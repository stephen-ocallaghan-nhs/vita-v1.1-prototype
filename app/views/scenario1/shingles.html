      <p>Shingles is a common condition that causes a painful rash. It can sometimes lead to serious problems such as long-lasting pain, hearing loss or blindness.</p>

      <p>The shingles vaccine helps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>reduce your chances of getting shingles</li>
        <li>reduce your chances of getting serious problems if you do get shingles</li>

        </ul>
        <p>You'll be given 2 doses of the shingles vaccine. These are given between 8 weeks and 6 months apart.</p>
        <p>Ask your GP or care team if you're not sure if you're eligible for the shingles vaccine.</p>
