      <p>The MMR vaccine protects against:</p>

        <li>measles</li>
        <li>mumps</li>
        <li>rubella</li>

      <p>These 3 infections spread easily between people and can lead to serious problems including meningitis, blindness and hearing loss.</p>
      <p>If you're pregnant, getting measles can cause premature birth, miscarriage or still birth. And getting rubella can cause serious problems for your baby such as damage to their sight and hearing.</p>
      <p>2 doses of the MMR vaccine gives you long-term protection.</p>
      <p>Getting vaccinated also helps protect people who cannot be vaccinated, such as unborn babies, newborn babies and anyone with a weakened immune system.</p>

        Who should have the MMR vaccine
      </span>

    <div class="nhsuk-details__text">
      <p>The MMR vaccine is recommended for all babies and young children, but older children and adults can have it if they were not vaccinated when they were younger.</p>
      
      <h4>Babies and young children</h4>
      <p>Babies and young children are given 2 doses of the MMR vaccine as part of the NHS vaccination schedule.</p>
      <p>They're given a dose at:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 year old</li>
        <li>3 years and 4 months</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Babies between 6 and 12 months can have an extra dose of the MMR vaccine before this if they need it to protect them if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>they're travelling abroad to an area with a lot of measles</li>
        <li>they've been close to someone with measles</li>
        <li>there's an outbreak of measles</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Older children and adults</h4>
      <p>The MMR vaccine can be given at any age.</p>
      <p>Speak to a GP about getting vaccinated if you did not have it as a child, you only had 1 dose or you're not sure if you've been fully vaccinated.</p>
      <p>It's especially important to make sure you're vaccinated if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>you're a child, teenager or young adult</li>
        <li>you could become pregnant</li>
        <li>you're travelling to, or living in, a country where there is a higher risk of getting measles, mumps or rubella</li>
        <li>you're a healthcare worker</li>
        <li>you were born between 1970 and 1990 (as you may not have been vaccinated against all 3 infections)</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="nhsuk-u-padding-bottom-3"></div>
      <p>Your GP surgery should be able to tell you which vaccinations you've already had.</p>
      <p>If you were born before 1970 and have not had measles, mumps or rubella (german measles) or their vaccines, you can ask your GP surgery for the MMR vaccine.</p>

      <h2>Who cannot have the MMR vaccine</h2>
      <p>Most people who need the MMR vaccine can have it.</p>
      <p>But because it's a live vaccine, which means it contains a weakened version of measles, mumps and rubella, it's not suitable for everyone.</p>
      <p>The MMR vaccine is not given if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>you're pregnant</li>
        <li>you have a weakened immune system, either because of a health condition or because you are taking medicines that suppress the immune system</li>
        <li>you've had a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to any ingredients in the vaccine, including gelatine or neomycin</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Your GP surgery will usually contact you about your child's MMR vaccinations. This will usually be by letter, text message, phone call or email.</p>
      <p>Older children who missed being vaccinated when they were younger may also be able to get the MMR vaccine through their school.</p>
      <p>If you need the MMR vaccine for your work, you should be able to get it through your employer's occupational health service.</p>
